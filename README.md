# CheezeDAO

An universe of Cowvens. 

CheezeDAO is the political extension of the Cheezyverse, it is a governance experiment looking to showcase the possibilities of liquid and skill based governance while bringing cross tournament ranking, team playing and engagement incentive to extensibles games.
CheezeDAO lower the entry barrier to play around with DAO as voting power is not defined by your identity nor your money but actually by your in game win/loss ratio and the reputation given to it, and this reputation is not attached to your wallet, but to your Cheeze wizards!
